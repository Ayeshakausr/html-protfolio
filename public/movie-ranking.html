<h3>RAJA RANI</h3>
<P>In this movie the understanding between the married couple is excellently potraied.They dispite of knowing their past love hold each other so carefully and support each other and continue to live a happy life.</P>
<h3>TARE ZAMEEN PAR</h3>
<p>The movie is all about the little boy, who is neglected by his parents and the way he feels that he is a failure and out of nowhere a teacher appears to him and brings out talent out of him and makes him a boy who is so capable of facing the failures and moving forward and standing out for himself in all the situations.</p>
